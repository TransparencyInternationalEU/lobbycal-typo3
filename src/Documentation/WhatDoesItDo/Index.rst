What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension displays the meetings of individual members of the European Parliament with lobbyists. It can also be used by any person who wants to keep a public record of their meetings.

The extension retrieves data via a REST API of a lobbycal server, which manages meeting invitations.

It is one of several clients to the lobbycal server. A wordpress plugin and a static html version is available, too.
